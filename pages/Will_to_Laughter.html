<p><h2>Eternal Recurrence and the Will to Laughter</p>

</h2></p>

</center>

<p>
<p>
Nietzsche thought that the basic "stuff" of the world was not atoms or love or survival or God but the "Will to Power". I have objected to his choice of words <a href="http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/Will_to_Power_-_Comments.html">here</a>. I accept power as the best candidate, but I propose a complimentary yin-yang partner. I call it the "Will to Laughter" and it is intimately involved with Eternal Recurrence. It is the world's delight in it's own useless playfulness. Awareness is the world's mystical experience. 
</p>
<p>
We humans waste life on a neurotic, futile, social fantasy flight from our personal death. We have lost the majestic awareness that animals have for their world. What we call "consciousness", a silly mish-mosh of awareness, thought, head-dancing and fantasy-world is laughable. Our knowledge, scientific and otherwise, deposited in university verbiage factories is pitifully cluttered, cowardly and blind. Chaos theory and Nassim Taleb's exposure of 
accademic pretentions are a good start for a healthy skepticism 
about universities, "knowledge" and "authorities" of all kinds.
<!--
A good example was all the "genius" economics professors cheering on the internet and housing bubbles. 
-->
</p><p>We haven't even come close to accepting the first basic truth of our modern situation, that technology is life's way of making a species weaker. 
Every time we get in a car instead of walking or running or dancing . . . every time we cover symptoms with drugs or play it safe with shotgun antibiotic consumption . . . every time we apply university categories or theories to our local situation instead of waking up to look at it . . . every time we substitute the fake drama of movies and TV for the drama and play of those close to us . . . every day we live in
those artificial, sterile, controllable, laboratory-like boxes called houses, offices and stores  . . . - . . .
 our bodies get a little weaker, a little stupider. Human pretentions of power are an amazingly huge source of laughter. After many generations of this behavior the human body will become extremely weak and fragile.  We will have squandered the 2 billion year strength that our bodies have accumulated without technology.  It may be time for life to invent something new.

</p>
<p> I am not proposing any new ideal to "save" or even "improve" humanity.  I am making a call to wake up from social fantasies to the immediate world around you that you can see and touch.
