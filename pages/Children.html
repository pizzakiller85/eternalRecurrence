<p><h2>Waking Up to Your Children
</h2></p>
</center>
<p>

</p>
<p>Morals are silly and poisonous.  You will not "save" your children in any way.  Your "responsibilities" to them 
are physical protection (food and basic shelter),  making their childhood 
childlike (90% of which is leaving them alone) and enjoying their company as much as your 
spirit can (since you will be spending eternity with them).  Until the rest of your 
neighbors and fellow citizens give up their religious and/or self-realization moral crusades (which may be never) 
you'll also have to gently protect them from your neighbors.
</p>
<p>
Moral pretensions dissolve and you are left watching these wonderous, miraculous beings.  If 
there is an ounce of play left in your spirit you can interact with these play-teachers and 
you're in the best heaven that life can give.
