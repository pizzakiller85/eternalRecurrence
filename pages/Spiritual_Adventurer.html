<p><h2>Becoming a Spiritual Adventurer</p>
</h2>
</center>
</center>
<p>Awareness is the world's mystical experience.  Give the world a thrill.  Become a spiritual adventurer.
</p>
<p>
 Humans can start to enter a new phase in their history. All the wasted energy of making believe you continue after death evaporates.  The world appears. Adventures can begin.  Of course your world 
contains numerous people who will not like anyone exposing, mocking or even ignoring their social fantasies.
You still play the social games -  only they're not important anymore.  Those close to you, family 
and friends, probably won't understand.  It doesn't matter. They are more real and more lovely to 
look at than ever.  You respond as you always have, but without the fear, without the edge.  Laughter
is  always very close . . .  but unseen. 
</p>
<p>
Urges to preach "The New Awareness" make you laugh at yourself. It is as self-contradictory as 
a zen koan.  </p>
<p>
Nietzsche's "love of fate", "that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, 
not backward, not in all eternity" becomes more real to you.
</p>
<p>
There's no one to save, no one to bring to self-realization, no one even to awaken. Either you're destined 
to have the thought of eternal recurrence hit you or you're not.
</p>
<p>
What kind of adventures will you have? No one can tell you.  It's in your spirit and only you can ride your spirit.
</p>

I'm not talking about the dreamworlds of LSD or other drugs. I'm talking about the mysteries of life that we modern intellectual consumers run away from  - birth, childhood, eating, (dreams,) sex, parenting, old age, death. I'm talking about the simple pleasures of life that all animals have and that we could bring a different color and tone to: Simple good homemade food, the rythyms of passionate activity and pleasurable rest, colors, textures, smells, 
sounds. I'm taking about playing with the people close to you, who share your life. Even dreaming has it's place, if we don't chop it up into little pieces and try to control it.
 


Like any good yang has an accompaning good yin, there is still the full panolopy of evils, fears
We're just not so nervous not so chatty about them.


 </p>
 <p>  Any wild animal that hunts, forages, mates, runs, plays, conquers is giving the world more of a thrill than most of neurotic, hyperactive, overstimulated, spaced-out humanity.  There's nothing wrong with being neurotic, hyperactive, overstimulated and spaced-out, as long as you don't 
think it's making the world better or that you're higher than animals.  </p>
